# demo-Web-testing-with-Selenium
Project to test Serenity with Selenium and Cucumber

* Demo project to know how to architecture a test project which has some complexity.
* Here is a framework that uses the same philosophy that we want to see: [ARQGRA2](https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ARQGRA2/Getting+Started)
* The project is following the Page Object pattern. Where a class express the interface of a page and nothing related to a test can be inside the class. So:
  * No __webElement__ should be exposed from a page object.
  * No assert can be done inside a page object. So, be careful if you write a mehtod to verify anything in a page class, ie returns a boolean, that your are not coupled to a test.

## Getting started
You can improve __everything__ in the project with a PR:
* You need to create a git branch, following the naming convention _feature/whatever_
* Make a pull request!
* Thank you in advance for your contribution!!!!
    
### Prerequisites
* **Git**:  [See the Git best practices](docs/git-best-practices.md).
* **Java Development Kit**: [See the Java best practices](docs/java-best-practices.md).
* **Gradle**: Use gradle wrapper.
* **IDE**: see [intelliJ](docs/intelliJ.md)/[eclipse](docs/eclipse.md), depending on your prefered IDE.
* **Gherkin**: [Gherkin - best practices & tips](docs/gherkin.md).

### Structure

#### Application mirror
* src/main/java.../__domain__: DTO objects (for the data interface of every page)
* src/main/java.../__pages__: Page objects

#### Application tests

* src/test/resources/__features__: create a structure in order to have all the features of a page in the same folder.
* src/test/java/,,,/__builders__: use the patter _Builder_ and _Data Builder_ in order to encapsulate the managemenet of the data needed for the tests.
* src/test/java/,,,/__domain__: DTO to access the API of the AUT (application under test).
* src/test/java/,,,/__services__: use the pattern _Facade_ to encapsulate the initialization of the data scenario. This initialization should be done be calling the API services of the AUT or DB (using a DAO), but never initialize the data calling another pages of the AUT.
* src/test/java/,,,/__stepsdefs__: create a StepDef per Feature, and follow the same package structure as the related feature
  * For commonn steps to different stepDef, but within the same folder, create a CommonStepDef
  * Use _Serenity.getCurrentSession().put/get_ to share common data between related steps definitions classes
* src/test/java/,,,/__tests__: here you have the classes to run the tests
  
## Configuration
* This is a gradle project, you can import it from your favorite IDE as Gradle project.
* To verify that all is up to date with dependencies and test compilation, execute the gradle task: _testClasses_

```cmd
    gradlew.bat testClasses
```
* Before execute the tests, execute the gradle task: **_downloadChromeDriverServer_**

### Compilation
* From IntelliJ: [See intelliJ config](docs/intelliJ.md).
* From Eclipse: [See eclipse config](docs/eclipse.md).
* From command line: 

### Execution
gradle test -Dcucumber.options="--tags @something"

## TODO
Use https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager


* docker-compose up
* Selenium Grid Console http://localhost:4444/grid/console
* Zalenium http://localhost:4444/grid/admin/live
